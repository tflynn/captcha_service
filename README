captcha_service description
===========================

captcha_service is supplied as a Ruby Gem.

captcha_service provides a lightweight wrapping for various open and for-pay
on-line captcha services. Currently, a simple API is provided. Different captcha
services are selected at configuration time.

Currenty Mack, Rails and other application stacks are supported.

The following captcha providers are supported:

Captchator - http://captchator.com/ - (Free - limited volume)

Mollom - http://mollom.com (Commercial)
  Requires mollom gem Version 0.1.4
  Requires Private/Public keys from Mollom

captcha_service API
===================

There are three captcha_service API calls

captcha_service API: Get a provider instance
--------------------------------------------

provider = CaptchaService::Configurator.get_provider

captcha_service API: Get an image tag and a verification key
------------------------------------------------------------

captcha_key, captcha_image_tag = provider.image_tag

captcha_service API: Validate a captcha answer
----------------------------------------------

answer = provider.verify_answer(captcha_key,captcha_answer)

answer is a boolean - true/false

Sample Applications
===================

Sample applications showing how to implement the captcha_service APIs
are provided in ./spec/test_apps.

Configuration
=============

Create a YAML file 'captcha_service.yml' with the following format:

----------------------------------------------
captcha_service:
  :default_provider: :mollom
  :providers:
    :captchator:
    :mollom:
      :private_key: 'f7c63d37d6a9ebdb62aca64688b38901'
      :public_key: '2c3f421dd5b32c6fe217dca701bc8972'
-----------------------------------------------

You can actually name it whatever you like.

Note: The Mollon keys are not valid. See description at top of README



For Configatron-based Systems - e.g. Mack
------------------------------------------

Place the file in a suitable location. For this discussion, place in
'./config/configurator/'.

In './config/configurator/default.rb' add the line:

configatron.captcha_service.configuration_filename = './config/configatron/captcha_service.yml'

If you need overrides by environment, then place these files in the same location,
using the standard naming conventions. E.g.

./config/configatron/captcha_service_production.yml
./config/configatron/captcha_service_development.yml
./config/configatron/captcha_service_test.yml

captcha_service will find these files and use their values to override the defaults.

For ApplicationConfiguration-based systems
------------------------------------------

(This section uses RAILS as an example)

Place the file in a suitable location. For this discussion, place in
'./config'.

In './config/application_configuration.yml' add the line:

captcha_service:
  :configuration_filename: './config/captcha_service.yml'

If you need overrides by environment, then place these files in the same location,
using the standard naming conventions. E.g.

./config/captcha_service_production.yml
./config/captcha_service_development.yml
./config/captcha_service_test.yml

captcha_service will find these files and use their values to override the defaults.

For other systems
-----------------

Set the environment variable:

CAPTCHA_SERVICE_CONFIGURATION_FILE

to point to the fully qualified nane of the captcha_service configuration file.

If you further specify the environment variable:

CAPTCHA_SERVICE_ENVIRONMENT

this will be used to find an additional environment-specific file in the same location
as the default captcha_service configuration file.

The file name is obtained by appending the environment name to the default configuration
file name with an underscore '-' as a separator.

viz: 

CAPTCHA_SERVICE_CONFIGURATION_FILE="/usr/apps/configuration/captcha_service.yml"
CAPTCHA_SERVICE_ENVIRONMENT='serious_production'

The environment-specific file will be named:

"usr/apps/configuration/captcha_service_serious_production_.yml"

Mack
-----

captcha_service knows about Mack environments and logging. It will log error messages
to 'Mack.logger'.


RAILS
-----

captcha_service knows about RAILS environments and logging. It will log error messages
to 'RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER'.

Other Environments
------------------

Currently, there is no support for 3rd party logging.
